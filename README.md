FluentAI is inspired by the method detailed in the paper [SmartPhone: Exploring Keyword Mnemonic with Auto-generated Verbal and Visual Cues by Jaewook Lee and Andrew Lan](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10436.pdf). The aim is to recreate their approach using accessible, open-source models.
The pipeline they propose, as shown below, serves as the blueprint for our project. It illustrates the process of automating language learning, blending cutting-edge AI techniques with proven language learning methodology.

In the image below you can see a more detailed process of deriving the mnemonic word.
