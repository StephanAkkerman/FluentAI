FluentAI is inspired by the method detailed in the paper [SmartPhone: Exploring Keyword Mnemonic with Auto-generated Verbal and Visual Cues by Jaewook Lee and Andrew Lan](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10436.pdf). The aim is to recreate their approach using accessible, open-source models.
The pipeline they propose, as shown below, serves as the blueprint for our project. It illustrates the process of automating language learning, blending cutting-edge AI techniques with proven language learning methodology.

## Mnemonic Word Generation

In the image below you can see a more detailed process of deriving the mnemonic word, which is the core of the project. The mnemonic word is a word that is easy to remember and that is associated with the word you want to learn. This is done by using a pre-trained model to generate a sentence that is then used to generate a mnemonic word. In the image above this is refered to as "TransPhoner", as this is where the image below is derived from.

### Imageability

The imageability of a word is a measure of how easily a word can be visualized. This is important for the mnemonic word, as it should be easy to visualize. To determine the imageability of a word, we train a model on this [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/StephanAkkerman/imageability). It includes the embeddings for each word and their imageability score. The embeddings are generated by the FastText model and these embeddings can be used to predict the imageability of words that are not in the dataset.

### Phonetic Similarity

The phonetic similarity of a word is a measure of how similar the pronunciation of two words is. This is important for the mnemonic word, as it should be easy to remember. Therefore we use this to determine which English words should be considered for the mnemonic word. We use the CLTS and PanPhon models to generate the feature vectors of the IPA representation of the words. These feature vectors are then used to calculate the phonetic similarity between the words. We use faiss to speed up the search for the most similar words.

### Orthographic Similarity

The orthographic similarity of a word is a measure of how similar the spelling of two words is. This is a very simple process and the user can select a few methods that they'd like to use.

### Semantic Similarity

The semantic similarity of a word is a measure of how similar the meaning of two words is. The FastText model is used to generate the embeddings of the words and these embeddings are used to calculate the semantic similarity between the words.

### Best Mnemonic Word

To determine the best mnemonic word, we use the methods described above. The results of each methods are given as a score (between 0 and 100) and these scores are combined to determine the best mnemonic word. The user can select the weights of each method to determine how important each method is.
