## Introduction

mnemorai is inspired by the method detailed in the paper [SmartPhone: Exploring Keyword Mnemonic with Auto-generated Verbal and Visual Cues by Jaewook Lee and Andrew Lan](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10436.pdf). The aim is to recreate their approach using accessible, open-source models.
The pipeline they propose, as shown below, serves as the blueprint for our project. It illustrates the process of automating language learning, blending cutting-edge AI techniques with proven language learning methodology.

## Prerequisites üìã

### Hardware
This project will work only if you have a Windows or Linux device with a GPU that supports CUDA. The recommended amount of VRAM to run mnemorai is minumum 8GB.

### Software
Before starting, make sure you have the following requirements:

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) installed on your device.
- [Anki-Connect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/) This add-on allows you to add cards to Anki from the command line.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your device (check the supported versions at the top).
- [React](https://react.dev) installed on your device (optional).

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Using `pip`

We have bundled all required dependencies into a package for easy installation. To get started, simply run one of the following commands:

```bash
pip install backend/. --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StephanAkkerman/mnemorai.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mnemorai
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install backend/. --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
   ```

## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è

Using mnemorai is simple, after following the steps in [pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) you can start the back-end by executing the following command.
```bash
python mnemorai/services/card_gen/api.py
``` 

### Docker üêã (Optional)

You can also run mnemorai using Docker. This is a great option if you want to avoid installing dependencies directly on your machine. To do so follow the steps in the Docker [README](backend/docker/README.md).

### Running the Front-End (Optional)

If you would like to build and host the front-end yourself you can do so by executing these commands.

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd mnemorai/frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the front-end:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will launch the front-end and connect it to the API for a seamless user experience.
