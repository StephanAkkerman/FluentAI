## Introduction

FluentAI is inspired by the method detailed in the paper [SmartPhone: Exploring Keyword Mnemonic with Auto-generated Verbal and Visual Cues by Jaewook Lee and Andrew Lan](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10436.pdf). The aim is to recreate their approach using accessible, open-source models.
The pipeline they propose, as shown below, serves as the blueprint for our project. It illustrates the process of automating language learning, blending cutting-edge AI techniques with proven language learning methodology.

## Prerequisites üìã

Before starting, make sure you have the following requirements:

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) installed on your device.
- [Anki-Connect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/) This add-on allows you to add cards to Anki from the command line.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10 installed on your device.
- [React](https://react.dev) installed on your device (optional).

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Using `pip`

We have bundled all required dependencies into a package for easy installation. To get started, simply run one of the following commands:

```bash
pip install .
```

or install directly from the repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/StephanAkkerman/FluentAI.git
```

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StephanAkkerman/FluentAI.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd FluentAI
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Install with GPU Support (Recommended)

If you would like to run the code on a GPU, you can install the `torch` package with CUDA support.
After installing the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/gpu-requirements.txt
```

## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è

Using FluentAI is simple, after following the steps in [pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) you can start the back-end by executing the following command.
```bash
python fluentai/services/card_gen/api.py
``` 

### Running the Front-End (Optional)

If you would like to build the front-end yourself you can do so by executing these commands.

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd fluentai/frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will launch the front-end and connect it to the API for a seamless user experience.
