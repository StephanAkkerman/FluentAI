# FluentAI
> [!CAUTION]
> This project is currently under development, please see the issues to see everything that still needs to be done before this is ready to use.

FluentAI is inspired by the method detailed in the paper [SmartPhone: Exploring Keyword Mnemonic with Auto-generated Verbal and Visual Cues by Jaewook Lee and Andrew Lan](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10436.pdf). The aim is to recreate their approach using accessible, open-source models.
The pipeline they propose, as shown below, serves as the blueprint for our project. It illustrates the process of automating language learning, blending cutting-edge AI techniques with proven language learning methodology.

Join us as we embark on this journey to make language acquisition faster, more efficient, and overall, more enjoyable.
